From the Ludum Dare entry page:

GAMEPLAY RELATED ===== 
-Arrow keys move, spacebar attacks. 

-If you (or a knight) are hit when pulling your sword back after an attack, you will take damage. You can use this strategically if you want (it isn't a bug, I meant for it to be this way). You can also back off the screen to stop knights from attacking you, ie: pause. 

-There are three types of knights (all wanting to go on noble quests) that are designed (poorly perhaps) to be defeated using different strategies: coward, brave, and heroic. Each has a slightly different AI. This was my first time ever coding AI. 

-Get a lot of kills and beat the waves of (somewhat) varying difficulty to beat the game. 


===== NOT(GAMEPLAY RELATED)====== 
-This is my second Ludum Dare. I am content with my creation :) 

-The sprites were made with plasticine and photographed (then edited). 

-Comments and critique are always welcome.
